# theseus_vs_minotaur
This is the repository of the game Theseus Vs Minotaur that I wrote for our C#.NET course. Test-driven development was used to write the Model of the game.
The challenge was to write the game's data structure where the View and the Model can work interchangeably with the other student. 
For this task, I managed to use the Model and the View that I code to work with three other students with minimum effort.
